# yamnet_finetun
By incorporating these scripts into the YAMNet code (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet), you can fine-tune the model.

The only modifications made to the original code were a minor adjustment in the yamnet.py file and the inclusion of another script used for fine-tuning the model.
